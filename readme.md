# Citizen Assembly Register

Dataset to track citizens assemblies in the UK.

This acts as a repository of known assemblies, and an archive of reports.  The dataset can be downloaded from: https://pages.mysociety.org/citizen-assembly-data/

Report issues either directly through GitHub issues: https://github.com/mysociety/citizen-assembly-data/issues/new/choose or email research@mysociety.org

To add (or modify existing) assemblies, modify the YAML files in `data/raw/assemblies`.
