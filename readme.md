# Citizen Assembly Register

Dataset to track citizens assemblies in the UK.

This acts as a repository of known assemblies, and an archive of reports.  The dataset can be downloaded from: https://pages.mysociety.org/citizen-assembly-data/

Report new assemblies or issues with existing data [either directly through GitHub issues](https://github.com/mysociety/citizen-assembly-data/issues/new/choose), or email research@mysociety.org.

If comfortable with Github and pull requests, data can be added or modified through the YAML files in `data/raw/assemblies`. The actual file name is not important but should ideally match the eventual internal ID.
