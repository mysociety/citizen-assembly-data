assembly_description: The Devon Climate Assembly brought together residents from across
  Devon to deliberate on key challenges in how Devon should respond to the climate
  emergency. The assembly focused on topics such as the role of onshore wind in the
  renewable energy strategy, encouraging less car use, and retrofitting homes and
  businesses to reduce carbon emissions. The assembly met for eleven sessions during
  June and July 2021 and was convened and facilitated by Involve, a public participation
  charity.
