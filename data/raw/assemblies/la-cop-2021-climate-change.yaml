assembly_description: The Copeland People's Panel on Climate Change was a deliberative
  process that aimed to engage with citizens on how to address the challenge of the
  climate emergency. The panel consisted of 30 diverse members of the local population
  who came together over a period of two months to discuss and share their opinions
  on climate change and its impact on Copeland. The panel received presentations from
  experts and worked collaboratively to develop a set of 22 recommendations on addressing
  climate change in the region. The recommendations cover various topics such as transport,
  education, energy generation, and behavior change. The panel's work was sponsored
  through funding from the National Lottery Climate Action Fund and Copeland Borough
  Council.
