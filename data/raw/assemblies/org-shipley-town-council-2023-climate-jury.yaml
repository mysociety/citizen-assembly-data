assembly_description: The Shipley Town Council Citizens’ Jury, commissioned
  by Shipley Town Council with support from a National Lottery ‘Together for
  Our Planet’ grant, brought together 25 residents to explore how local
  stakeholders could work together to limit climate change and its impacts
  while protecting their environment and health. The juery produced seven
  headline recommendations including building retrofit and skills development,
  the creation of a ‘pollinator corridor’ of private and public green spaces,
  and giving greater priority to pedestrian and people-powered transport.
