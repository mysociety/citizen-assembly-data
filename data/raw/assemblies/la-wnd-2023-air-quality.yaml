assembly_description: The Wandsworth Citizens' Assembly on Air Quality was a deliberative
  process commissioned by Wandsworth Council to address the issue of air pollution
  in the borough. The assembly aimed to involve the public in identifying strategies
  and actions to improve air quality and address climate change. The assembly members,
  selected through a lottery process, spent four full Saturdays discussing, learning,
  and deliberating on the topic. They received presentations from commentators and
  had the opportunity to question them. The assembly produced a set of fifty recommendations
  on how to tackle air quality in Wandsworth, which will form the basis of a new Air
  Quality Action Plan.
