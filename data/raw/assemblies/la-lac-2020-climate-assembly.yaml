assembly_description: The Lancaster Climate Change Peopleâ€™s Jury was a deliberative
  process commissioned by Lancaster City Council to address the climate emergency.
  It involved thirty residents from across the district who were recruited through
  a stratified sampling process. The jury met for sixteen sessions between February
  and October 2020 to discuss and answer the question of what needs to be done in
  homes, neighborhoods, and districts to respond to the emergency of climate change.
  The process included presentations from expert witnesses and deliberation among
  the jury members. The jury's goal was to reach a set of recommendations on how the
  Lancaster district can best address the climate emergency.
