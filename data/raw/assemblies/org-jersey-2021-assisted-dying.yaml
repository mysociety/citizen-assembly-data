assembly_description: A citizens' jury in Jersey was convened to consider the question
  of whether assisted dying should be permitted in the country, and if so, under what
  circumstances. The jury heard from a range of speakers, discussed the topic, and
  completed three different votes to provide a final response. The recommendations
  from the jury will inform a States Assembly debate on assisted dying.
